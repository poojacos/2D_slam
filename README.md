In this project, the structure of mapping and localization in an indoor environment is implemented using information from an IMU and range sensors. Information from IMU orientation and odometry information is integrated from a walking humanoid with a 2D laser range scanner (LIDAR) in order to build a 2D occupancy grid map of the walls and obstacles in the environment.
